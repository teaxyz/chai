### Priority Areas (Low Coverage <50%)
1. **Critical (Core)**: core/db.py (24%), core/fetcher.py (31%), core/utils.py (33%), core/transformer.py (42%)
2. **Critical (Crates)**: All crates modules except structs.py
3. **High (pkgx)**: parser.py (37%), url.py (46%)
4. **Medium**: homebrew/diff.py (62%), core/config.py (64%)

### **Total Coverage**: 83% for core modules (was ~40% average) â†’ Target: 100%

**ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR PROGRESS: Core modules now have 83% average coverage vs. previous ~40%!**

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Critical)
Focus on core modules that are used across all package managers:

1. **core/db.py** - Database operations, connections, queries
2. **core/fetcher.py** - HTTP requests, caching, retry logic  
3. **core/utils.py** - Utility functions used throughout
4. **core/transformer.py** - Data transformation pipeline

### Phase 2: Package Manager Specific (High Priority)
Focus on package managers with very low coverage:

1. **Crates package manager** - Complete overhaul needed (13-19% coverage)
2. **pkgx parser and URL modules** - Complex parsing logic needs testing
3. **Homebrew diff module** - Dependency diffing algorithm

### Phase 3: Configuration and Edge Cases
1. **core/config.py** - Configuration loading and validation
2. **Remaining edge cases and error paths**

### Testing Strategy
- **Mock Strategy**: Use existing fixtures from conftest.py, extend with package-specific mocks
- **Database Testing**: Mock database operations, avoid real DB dependencies
- **HTTP Testing**: Mock requests using responses library or similar
- **Error Testing**: Test failure modes, invalid inputs, network errors
- **Edge Cases**: Empty responses, malformed data, boundary conditions

## Progress Tracking
- [x] **Phase 1 Core Infrastructure: 83% Complete** ðŸš€
  - [x] core/db.py: 92% âœ…
  - [x] core/fetcher.py: 83% âœ…
  - [x] core/transformer.py: 100% âœ…
  - [x] core/utils.py: 100% âœ…
  - [ ] core/config.py: 64% (remaining)
- [ ] Phase 2 Complete (Package managers 100%) 
- [ ] Phase 3 Complete (Configuration 100%)
- [ ] Final validation (Overall 100%)

### Next Immediate Steps
1. **Fix failing tests** - Address mocking issues and model constructor problems
2. **Core config.py** - Improve remaining 36% coverage 
3. **Package managers** - Move to crates, homebrew, pkgx modules
4. **Final validation** - Achieve 100% overall coverage
